This week, E-Ride’s Phynious Chilufya and GSMA - Mobile for Development’s Ezra K. met with the Commissioner for Refugees, Tovine D. Kaneneka, in Lusaka. The meeting focused on an upcoming project in collaboration with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency and the Meheba settlement. Exciting developments are on the horizon. Stay tuned!

Today, we join the nation in honouring Kenneth Kaunda's enduring legacy. His commitment to unity and development inspires everything we do at E-Ride Africa. Here's to building a sustainable future together! hashtag#KennethKaundaDay hashtag#ProudlyZambian hashtag#ERideAfrica

We are very grateful to be a part of this! Thank you to the GSMA - Mobile for Development for supporting us.

It was a pleasure hosting the ZAMBIA ROAD SAFETY TRUST at our offices last week. During the visit, we discussed the impressive cost savings achieved so far and explored the potential of electric mobility options to further reduce environmental impact. We also had the opportunity to answer their insightful questions about sustainable transport solutions and how these can contribute to a cleaner, greener Zambia. We’re excited to continue driving change towards a more sustainable future together!

A few months ago we were selected to be in the top 10 for the UNDP Zambia and BongoHive Technology and Innovation Hub Meet the Toshikas competition. It was an honour to have BongoHive as well as Double Feather Partners at our offices in April to see our operations and manufacturing. We appreciate all we have learned and the connections we've made.

At E-Ride, we're more than just electric bikes. Our team powers every stage of production, from battery assembly to precision 3D printing, CNC cutting, grinding, and welding. In this video, get a closer look at the full range of services that bring our innovative designs to life.

Our electric vehicles are equipped with tracking systems. Below are some incredible results from a project we did with a delivery company in Lusaka, Zambia. Enjoy! hashtag#ElectricMobility hashtag#GreenEnergy

One of the top questions we get at E-Ride is about charging our electric bikes. We hear you! In this quick video, we’re showing just how simple it is to remove and charge the battery. Whether you're at home, the office, or out exploring, powering up your ride has never been easier.


Happy Youth Day, Zambia!

Today, we celebrate the energy, resilience, and potential of Zambia’s youth, the driving force of innovation and change.

At E-Ride Africa, we believe in empowering young people with sustainable mobility solutions that create opportunities and improve livelihoods. Recently, we had the privilege of hosting the Zambia Road Safety Trust, reinforcing the importance of safe and responsible riding for a better future.
We appreciate the ZAMBIA ROAD SAFETY TRUST for the impactful work they do in educating and equipping young people with the knowledge to stay safe on the roads. Their efforts are shaping a generation that understands the value of responsible mobility.

Mobility is more than just movement; it is about access to education, jobs, and a sustainable future. This Youth Day, we encourage young Zambians to dream big, take action, and build the future they want to see.
How can we further support and empower young people in Zambia? Share your thoughts below!


E-Ride Africa is excited to collaborate with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency and GSMA - Mobile for Development on a transformative pilot project at the Meheba Refugee Settlement in Zambia. Our recent site visit highlighted the significant impact electric mobility could have in improving daily life and creating new opportunities for refugees
Key points we will verify within this project:
•Access to transport means greater independence and the ability to earn a living.
•E-bikes provide a more affordable and sustainable alternative to petrol-powered transport.
•Community collaboration is essential to ensure a fair and inclusive transition.

We are working on the pilot rollout of electric motorcycles and solar charging stations, working closely with local committees to support safe and equitable access. This initiative is about more than mobility—it’s about empowering people, strengthening communities, and building a more sustainable future.
We welcome partners who share our commitment to meaningful change. Let’s move forward together.

Congratulations to Jacob Anz for successfully completing the Mentorpitch Program!

After 12 weeks of intensive coaching and mentoring, Jacob, along with four other Zambian start-ups, is now investment-ready. A big thank you to BongoHive Technology and Innovation Hub, Zambia Business Angels Network (ZBAN), and TVCLabs for facilitating this transformative program. Your dedication to nurturing entrepreneurial talent is vital for the growth of Zambia’s startup ecosystem.

The program’s focus on refining business models, improving financial projections, and strengthening pitch delivery has provided participants with the tools and confidence to attract investors. Such initiatives not only equip start-ups with the technical knowledge to scale but also create valuable networking opportunities and exposure to funding sources.

At E-Ride, we are inspired by initiatives like the Mentorpitch Program that empower entrepreneurs and pave the way for innovation and growth in Zambia's competitive market.

Let’s continue supporting programs like this that contribute to the success of Zambia’s entrepreneurial community.

We were delighted to host the Zambia Road Safety Trust at our offices last week. It was a pleasure to connect with like-minded partners who share our vision for a cleaner, greener Zambia. Thank you for your interest and commitment to a sustainable future!

We are really excited to welcome Fikru Tiruneh from our research and development office in Switzerland. Fikruh pursuing his masters in mechanical engineering with an emphasis on robotics. He will be assisting us here in Lusaka for a few weeks. We look forward to his insight and approach. 

We often get asked about the durability of our electric motorbikes. HOLLAND GREENTECH ZAMBIA has been making great use of our bikes to assist local communities in sustainable and profitable vegetable farming in rural errors. The bikes have proven to be sturdy and reliable time and time again. Electric is exciting.
